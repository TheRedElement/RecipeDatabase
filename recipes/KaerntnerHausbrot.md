|Ingredient|Amount (4 portions)|
| :- | :- |
|flour (rye)|300 g|
|water|225 mL|
|sourdough starter|100 g|
|flour (wheat)|50 g|
|yeast (dry)|7 g|
|aniseed|1 g|

## Recipe

### Dough
1. mix **flour (rye)**, **flour (wheat)**, **sourdough starter** ([SourDoughStarter](SourDoughStarter.md)), **yeast**, **salt**, **caraway**, **aniseed**, **fennel seeds**, **water**
	1. slowly knead to dough (ideally with *dough-hook*, by hand also works)
2. knead by hand until not sticky anymore
	1. should still be firm
3. cover bowl with cloth
	1. let sit for $\approx \pu{1h}$

### Baking
1. preheat oven to $\pu{225^\circ C}$ [Conventional](OvenSettings.md#Conventional)
2. place cast-iron pot into oven (heat bowl)
3. add extension cut to [Dough](#Dough)
	1. with sharp knife/razor blade: cut top of the dough in a cross-shape
	2. this allows the dough to expand more freely thus, leading to a more fluffy inside

4. place [Dough](#Dough) into cast-iron pot
	1. spray with water
	2. close lid (to ensure moisture stays inside)
5. put back in oven
6. *(place heat-resistant bowl with **water** into oven)*
7. bake [Dough](#Dough) for $\pu{15min}$
8. add expansion cut (cut across the loaf to make sure it can expand)
9. reduce heat to $\pu{180^\circ C}$ for $\pu{45min}$

## Notes
* **water** ensures that bread does not get dry while baking
