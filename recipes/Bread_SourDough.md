# Sour-Dough Bread

|Ingredient|Amount (4 portions)|
| :- | :- |
|flour (rye)|400 g|
|water|330 mL|
|flour (wheat)|200 g|
|sourdough starter|100 g|
|salt|12 g|

## Recipe
### Dough
1. mix **salt** in **sordough starter** ([SourDoughStarter](SourDoughStarter.md))
2. add a little bit of handwarm **water**
	1. dissolve
3. add **flour (rye)**, **four (wheat)**, **salt**
4. knead
	1. add more **water** if necessary
	2. dough should detach from the bowl after $\approx 3\,\pu{min}$
5. form a ball
6. cover bowl with cloth
7. let sit for $8\,h$ in warm location
8. add expansion cut
	1. with sharp knife/razor blade: cut top of the dough in a cross-shape
	2. this allows the dough to expand more freely thus, leading to a more fluffy inside

### Baking
1. preheat oven to $\pu{225^\circ C}$ [Conventional](OvenSettings.md#Conventional)
2. place cast-iron pot into oven (heat bowl)
3. add extension cut to [Dough](#Dough)
        1. with sharp knife/razor blade: cut top of the dough in a cross-shape
        2. this allows the dough to expand more freely thus, leading to a more fluffy inside

4. place [Dough](#Dough) into cast-iron pot
        1. spray with water
        2. close lid (to ensure moisture stays inside)
5. put back in oven
6. *(place heat-resistant bowl with **water** into oven)*
7. bake [Dough](#Dough) for $\pu{15min}$
8. add expansion cut (cut across the loaf to make sure it can expand)
9. reduce heat to $\pu{180^\circ C}$ for $\pu{45min}$
10. remove lid and bake for another $\pu{15min}$ with [Top Heat](OvenSettings.md#Top%20Heat)

## Notes


# Sour-Dough Bread v2

|Ingredient|Amount (4 portions)|
| :- | :- |
|flour (rye)|330 g|
|water|160 g|
|sourdough starter|100 g|
|oil (olive)|16 g|
|salt|7 g|

## Recipe
### Dough
1. dissolve [SourDoughStarter](SourDoughStarter.md) in warm **water** and **olive oil**
	1. use fork for mixing
2. add **flour (rye)**, **salt**
3. mix until dough becomes stiff
4. make sure to squish everything together with your hands to incorporate all of the **flour**

### Autolyse
1. cover with *very damp* clean kitchen towel
2. let rest for $\pu{30min}-\pu{60min}$
	1. the longer, the fluffier
 3. shape dough into rough ball
	 1. for about $\pu{15s}$

### Bulk Fermentation
1. total duration: $\approx \pu{8\,h}$
2. cover bowl with plastic wrap
3. let rest in warm spot to rise
	1. optionally perform [Stretch and Fold](#Stretch%20and%20Fold)
4. ready when
	1. no longer dense
	2. *almost* doubled in size

#### Stretch and Fold
1. starting $\pu{30min}$ into [Bulk Fermentation](#Bulk%20Fermentation) perfom strechtches and folds to strengthen dough
	1. take portion of dough
	2. stretch
	3. fold in on itself
	4. rotate bowl $\pu{90^\circ}$$
	5. repeat until done from all sides
2. repeat every $\pu{30min}$ for 4 times

### Shaping
1. repeat process similar to [Stretch and Fold](#Stretch%20and%20Fold) once
2. flip dough seam-side down
3. gently from into ball by cupping hands below
	1. goal: surface tension

### Proofing/Bench Rest
1. add parchment paper to cast-iron pot
	1. prevents sticking
2. place dough inside
3. cover with lid
4. let rest for $\pu{30min}-\pu{1h}$
	1. done when slightly puffy but *NOT* doubled in size

### Baking
1. preheat oven to $\pu{225^\circ C}$ [Conventional](OvenSettings.md#Conventional)
	1. ideally towards end of [Proofing/Bench Rest](#Proofing/Bench%20Rest)
#### Scoring
1. right before placing dough into oven
2. add extension cut to [Dough](#Dough)
	1. with sharp knife/razor blade: cut top of the dough in straight line
		1. cut shall be shallow
	2. allows the dough to expand more freely thus, leading to a more fluffy inside
3. spray with a little bit of water
	1. for crunchier crust
4. place bread into oven
5. bake for $\pu{20min}$ covered with lid
6. remove lid and bake for another $\pu{40min}$
	1. until deep, golden brown

### Cool Down
* before slicing let rest for $\pu{1h}$
	* prevents gummy texture
		* lets steam escape from inside
	* makes sure aromas from crust are present in inside as well

## Notes
* alternatives for **flour (rye)**
	* pretty much anything but **all purpose flour**
