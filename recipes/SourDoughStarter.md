* let sit for another $\pu{24h}$

### Day 5
* sourdough ready for baking

## Feeding the Dough
* if the starter has been expanding already
	* remove amount of the starter equal to the total amount you want to feed it with
		* either throw it away, or use it for baking
* add equal parts of $water (handwarm)$ and $flour (rye)$
* stir

## Keeping the Dough Starter Alive
### Option 1
* keep it in the fridge to suppress activity
* [Feeding the Dough](#Feeding%20the%20Dough) once a week

### Option 2
* [Feeding the Dough](#Feeding%20the%20Dough) it with same amount that is currently present divided equally between **flour (rye)** and **water (handwarm)**
	* i.e., for \pu{$}1cup$ of dough starter feed with $0\pu{.}5cup$ **water (handwarm)** and $0\pu{.}5cup$ **flour (rye)**
* [Feeding the Dough](#Feeding%20the%20Dough) has to be done every $\pu{12h}-\pu{24h}$
	* warmer homes closer to $\pu{12h}$
	* colder homes closer to $\pu{24h}$


## Notes
* when using for baking allow the sourdough starter to sit for \pu{$}4h-\pu{12h}$ 
* some things that might enhance your experience
	* diastatic malt powder
	* rye flour
	* cast-iron pot for baking (oven compliant)
