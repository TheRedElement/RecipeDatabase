|Ingredient|Amount (4 portions)|
| :- | :- |
|flour (rye) | 200 g |
|water (room temperature) | 200 g | 

## Recipe

### Day 1
1. add $\pu{50g}$ **flour (rye)** and $\pu{50g}$ **water (room temperature)** to $\pu{700mL}$ preserving jar
2. mix well
3. loosely cover with lid
4. let sit for $\pu{12h}$ 
5. stir once with wooden spoon or stick
6. let sit for another $\pu{12h}$

### Day 2
1. [Feeding](#Feeding) with $\pu{50g}$ and $\pu{50g}$
2. let sit for another $\pu{24h}$

### Day 3
1. * [Feeding](#Feeding) with $\pu{50g}$ and $\pu{50g}$
2. * let sit for another $\pu{24h}$

*dough starter should start to smell sour and generate small bubbles *

### Day 4
1. * [Feeding](#Feeding) with $\pu{50g}$ and $\pu{50g}$
2. * let sit for another $\pu{24h}$

### Day 5
1. sourdough ready for baking

|Ingredient|Amount (4 portions)|
| :- | :- |
|flour (rye) | 50 g |
|water (room temperature) | 50 g |


### Day 1
1. record
	1. weight of jar hosting the starter
	2. day of starter creation
	3. type of **flour** used
2. inside the jar mix $\pu{50g}$ **flour (rye)** with $\pu{50g}$ **water (room temperature)**
	1. combined mixture should be thick
3. scrape sides of jar to keep things clean
4. cover with loose-fitting lid
5. mark height of starter with **rubber band**
6. let sit for $\pu{12h}$
7. stir once
8. let sit for another $\pu{12h}$

### Raising the Starter
1. check the starter daily at around the same time
	1. if no change (usually day 2)
		1. let sit for $\pu{24h}$
	2. visible bubbles + doubled in size (usually day 3)
		1. discard half of the starter instead of the amount shown in [Feeding2](#Feeding2)
		2. [Feeding2](#Feeding2)
	3. lots of bubbles (usually day 4)
		1. [Feeding2](#Feeding2)
	4. bubbles + some growth (usually day 5)
		1. [Feeding2](#Feeding2)
	5. doubling in size (usually day 6-7)
		1. [Feeding2](#Feeding2)
	6. starter doubles in $\pu{4h}-\pu{6h}$ and begins to recede after $\pu{12h}$
		1. starter ready to use

### Baking Readiness Tests
1. starter doubles in $\pu{4h}-\pu{6h}$ and begins to recede after $\pu{12h}$
2. starter smells sour
3. starter has bubbles
4. starter has dome-shaped top layer
5. starter floats in bowl of water
		
### Feeding2
1. discard all BUT $\pu{100g}$ of the starter
2. feed with equal parts ($\pu{50g}$ each) of **flour (rye)** and **water (room temperature)**
3. mix well
4. scrape down the side
5. cover with loose-fitting lid
6. adjust **rubber band**
7. let rest for $\pu{24h}$


## Feeding
1. if the starter has been expanding already
	1. remove amount of the starter equal to the total amount you want to feed it with
		* either throw it away, or use it for baking
2. add equal parts of **water (room temperature)** and **flour (rye)**
3. stir

## Keeping the Dough Starter Alive
### Option 1
1. keep it in the fridge to suppress activity
2. [Feeding](#Feeding) once a week
	1. let sit at room temperature for $\pu{1h}-\pu{2h}$ before refrigerating again

### Option 2
1. [Feeding](#Feeding) always should be done with the same type of **flour** that you used in the beginning
2. [Feeding](#Feeding) with same amount that is currently present divided equally between **flour (rye)** and **water (room temperature)**
	1. i.e., for $\pu{1cup}$ of dough starter feed with $0\pu{.}5cup$ **water (room temperature)** and $0\pu{.}5cup$ **flour (rye)**
3. [Feeding](#Feeding) has to be done every $\pu{12h}-\pu{24h}$
	* warmer homes closer to $\pu{12h}$
	* colder homes closer to $\pu{24h}$
* when using for baking allow the sourdough starter to sit for $\pu{4h}-\pu{12h}$ after [Feeding](#Feeding)

## Preserving Part of the Starter
1. only works once starter is mature
2. separate $\pu{100g}$ and put in fridge
3. when needed 
	1. feed once 
	2. let sit for $\pu{12}-\pu{24h}$ (reactivation) 
	3. use as usual
4. if you're lucky and have a strong stater, it might survive for a few months in the fridge

## Notes
* good alternative for **four (rye)**: **flour (wheat)**, **four (wholemeal)**
	* other types work as well, but might take longer
* some things that might enhance your experience
	* diastatic malt powder
	* rye flour
	* cast-iron pot for baking (oven compliant)
